# Shannon-Fano coding and Hamming code
## Shannong-Fano coding
In the field of data compression, Shannonâ€“Fano coding, named after Claude Shannon and Robert Fano, is a name given to two different but related techniques for constructing a prefix code based on a set of symbols and their probabilities (estimated or measured).

## Hamming code
In computer science and telecommunication, Hamming codes are a family of linear error-correcting codes. Hamming codes can detect up to two-bit errors or correct one-bit errors without detection of uncorrected errors. [...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code)
